<para>I have provided all dependancies that should be required within the libs and gtk folders. So it should be easy to build and run. If for some reason you do hit a dependancy issue. Unix is very easy to get gtk set up on so: for macOs go the this link and follow the getting started steps: <ulink url="https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos/">https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos/</ulink> they havea fully built install script that handles everything for you for linux <ulink url="https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/">https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/</ulink> go to here and follow install guide or just clone the repo for it.</para>
<para>You can compile with this command if you want to.: gcc $( pkg-config <ndash/>cflags gtk4 ) -o example-0 <ref refid="main_8c" kindref="compound">main.c</ref> $( pkg-config <ndash/>libs gtk4 )</para>
<para>!!WARNING only minimize the windows of the app, once one is closed it will crash if reopened due to some weirdness with gtk that I didn&apos;t have time to look into</para>
<para>The RSA key gen is so very close to functional, the public key is correct and works, but the private key&apos;s exponent is consistantly off by around 10 which is a lot since its an exponent, but I cannot figure out how to fix my math to get it working. Its something with the mod inverse function that I cannot figure out how to fix. </para>
