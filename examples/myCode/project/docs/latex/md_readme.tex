I have provided all dependancies that should be required within the libs and gtk folders. So it should be easy to build and run. If for some reason you do hit a dependancy issue. Unix is very easy to get gtk set up on so\+: for mac\+Os go the this link and follow the getting started steps\+: \href{https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+gtk.\+org/docs/installations/macos/}} they havea fully built install script that handles everything for you for linux \href{https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/}{\texttt{ https\+://www.\+gtk.\+org/docs/installations/linux/}} go to here and follow install guide or just clone the repo for it.

You can compile with this command if you want to.\+: gcc \$( pkg-\/config --cflags gtk4 ) -\/o example-\/0 \doxylink{main_8c}{main.\+c} \$( pkg-\/config --libs gtk4 )

!!\+WARNING only minimize the windows of the app, once one is closed it will crash if reopened due to some weirdness with gtk that I didn\textquotesingle{}t have time to look into

The RSA key gen is so very close to functional, the public key is correct and works, but the private key\textquotesingle{}s exponent is consistantly off by around 10 which is a lot since its an exponent, but I cannot figure out how to fix my math to get it working. Its something with the mod inverse function that I cannot figure out how to fix.
